# Roll-or-Die
In the mystical land of Eldoria, a looming darkness threatened to engulf the realm in eternal night. Aelius, Bria, Cedric, and Daria, warriors of diverse backgrounds, 
united upon discovering a cryptic prophecy. It foretold of an enchanted die hidden within the mystical Fortress of Radiant Hope, where each roll would shape their destiny. 
As the clouds gathered, the heroes embarked on a treacherous journey, knowing that a roll of the die could either propel them forward or end their turn abruptly, passing the weighty responsibility to the next in line. 
The tapestry of luck and valor began to unfold, as the adventurers navigated the whims of fate in their quest to dispel the encroaching shadow and restore light to Eldoria.

Setup:

You need a six-sided die.
Decide on a goal (e.g., 20 points).
Determine the order of players.
Gameplay:

Players take turns rolling the die in the established order.
If a player rolls a 1, their turn ends, and their score resets to 0. The next player takes their turn.
If a player rolls 2-6, add that number to their current score and continue rolling.
A player can choose to end their turn and keep their accumulated score at any time before rolling a 1.
The next player then takes their turn.
Winning:

The first player to reach the goal without rolling a 1 wins the game.
Example Playthrough:
Players: A, B, C, D
Goal: 20 points

A rolls: 4 (A's score: 4)
A rolls: 2 (A's score: 6)
A rolls: 6 (A's score: 12)
A rolls: 3 (A's score: 15)
A rolls: 1 (A's turn ends, B's turn starts)
B rolls: 5 (B's score: 5)
B rolls: 2 (B's score: 7)
B rolls: 4 (B's score: 11)
B rolls: 1 (B's turn ends, C's turn starts)
C rolls: 1 (C's turn ends, D's turn starts)
The game continues until one player reaches the goal without rolling a 1.
